Set of Nodes to connect and Control Projectors via PJLink Protocol

_OVERVIEW-IMAGE HERE_

Based on a [library](https://github.com/Xcodo/pjlink-sharp) which was originally published [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pjlink-sharp/) on google code.
I just added some slight [modifications](https://github.com/sebllll/pjlink-sharp) to it.

You can read the Protocol [Specification](https://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english/data/5-1_PJLink_eng_20131210.pdf) here.
